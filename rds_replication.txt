Replication of RDS across the regions
=========================================
pre-requisites
---------------
# Ec2- 2
    sg----> 22-myip
 one ec2 in source region
 Another ec2 in destination region
# RDS in source region
# you can access the ec2 with two ways
  1) publicIP
  2) we will attach the Ec2 to Target Group and Access with Load balancer endpoint
# You need subnet Group to create RDS
# RDS security Group
      sg---> 3306-Ec2-sg
--------------------------------------------------------------
* Firstly, we have to create the RDS in one(source) region
* It will take some time to create, while creating "Remember the credentials-if needed store in secure place"
* After the RDS is in AVAILABLE state, select the particular database
* Then, Go to "Actions", choose "create a read replica"
* It will ask the "Source RDS"--choose the rds
* It will ask replica-rds name----provide the name
* It will ask the region, choose the region where you want to create your replica
* Then choose your subnet group,security group 
* Same process, how you create the rds
-----------------------------------------------
check
======
# ssh to the first Ec2 , Insert any data into the Ec2 or database and connect to database,it will appear in the source database and replica database.
