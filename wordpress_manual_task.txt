wordpress setup
-----------------
* After the Apache page(test) came.
* You must have to check the connection between wordpress-Ec2 to RDS by using Telnet
* For that Install the telnet 
* Just Install the Mysql, to check whether we are able to connecting the RDS or not
* If the connection is good, Go Ahead or else cross check the connections
* Then make a directory, clone the wordpress code in that directory from the SCM
* Then install the php-7.3 by using the " amazon-linux-extras install php7.3 "
* Then stop&&start the Apache
* Now check the UI, will you able to get the wordpress UI or not
  If not came,
 	      * just remove the php and install it again and re-start the apache
              * Still it won't came, just download the tar.gz file of wordpress from the wordpress official site by using the 
		wget <link>
	      * And Extract it
		tar -xvzf <file>
* After Extracting , Again stop && start the Apache
* It may works,
               After the wordpress UI came
* Actually wordpress, will default looks for "wp-config.php" file to connect the wordpress
	* For that purpose,we have to rename the "wp-sample-config.php" as "wp-config.php" and we have to make the empty of the file by using the command 
             echo '' > wp-config.php
        * After making the file empty, just check the content with "cat/more/less/vi/vim/nano"command.
* Then copy the content from the wordpress UI 
* And paste the copied content, in the "wp-config.php" file
* Then click on the "Run the Installation"
* After installed, connect to the database with the correct credentials , Make sure that you have to provide the correct credentials
